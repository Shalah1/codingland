A stack is a linear data structure in which all the insertion and deletion of data or you can say its values are done at one end only, rather than in the middle. Stacks can be implemented by using arrays of type linear.
The stack is mostly used in converting and evaluating expressions in Polish notations, i.e.:<br><br>
1-Infix 2-Prefix 3-Postfix<br><br>
In case of arrays and linked lists, these two allows programmers to insert and delete elements from any place within the list, i.e., from the beginning or the end or even from the middle also. 
But in computer programming and development, there may arise some situations where insertion and deletion require only at one end wither at the beginning or end of the list.
The stack is a linear data structure, and all the insertion and deletion of its values are done in the same end which is called the top of the stack. Let us suppose take the real-life example of a stack of plates or a pile of books etc.
As the item in this form of data structure can be removed or added from the top only which means the last item to be added to the stack is the first item to be removed. So you can say that the stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) structure.
