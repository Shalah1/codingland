The searching algorithms are used to search or find one or more than one element from a dataset. These type of algorithms are used to find elements from a specific data structures.

Searching may be sequential or not. If the data in the dataset are random, then we need to use sequential searching. Otherwise we can use other different techniques to reduce the complexity.
